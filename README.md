# linux-vpn
A Linux VPN script for the shell. 

This is a simple script that I needed when I had to frequenly connect and disconnect to different customers VPN connections (using PPTP) while troubleshooting their servers and VOIP equipmennt. It was much quicker than clicking through the GUI in Ubuntu or Mint, and faster than Windows Rasphone. I haven't did much work on the error codes, so that part needs improvement.
